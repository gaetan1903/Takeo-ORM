- [x] Repository pattern implementation
- [x] Gopy interface design for Python binding

### Phase 2: Python API Layer ✅
- [x] Entity decorator (`@Entity`)
- [x] Column decorators (`@Column`, `@PrimaryKey`)
- [x] Type system for database columns
- [x] Connection configuration and management
- [x] Repository class for CRUD operations
- [x] Python package structure and imports

### Phase 3: Integration & Bindings (In Progress)
- [ ] Gopy build configuration and setup
- [ ] Go-Python binding generation

## Success Metrics for MVP

### Performance Goals
- [ ] **Benchmark**: 2x faster than SQLAlchemy Core for basic CRUD operations
- [ ] **Memory**: Minimal memory overhead compared to pure Python solutions
- [ ] **Startup Time**: < 100ms initialization time for small applications

### Developer Experience Goals
- [x] **Familiar API**: TypeORM-like decorator syntax
- [x] **Easy Setup**: Single command installation and setup
- [x] **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive examples and guides
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Helpful error messages with suggestions

### Stability Goals
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >90% test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Full end-to-end testing with PostgreSQL
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Timeline

### Week 1-2: Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Project structure and Go core implementation
- ✅ Python API design and basic implementation
- ✅ Example applications and documentation

### Week 3-4: Integration
- ⏳ Gopy binding generation and testing
- ⏳ End-to-end integration testing
- ⏳ Error handling and stability improvements

### Week 5-6: Polish & Release
- ⏳ Performance testing and optimization
- ⏳ Documentation completion
- ⏳ PyPI package preparation and release

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Gopy Compatibility**: Ensure gopy can handle our Go interfaces effectively
2. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of Go objects from Python
3. **Error Propagation**: Meaningful error messages across language boundaries
4. **Type Conversion**: Correct data type mapping between Go and Python

### Mitigation Strategies
- Early prototyping with gopy to validate compatibility
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Clear documentation of limitations and workarounds
- Fallback to alternative binding methods if needed

## Community & Adoption

### Initial Target Users
- Python developers seeking better ORM performance
- Go developers wanting Python ecosystem integration
- Teams migrating from TypeORM to Python
- Performance-critical applications using Django/Flask

### Community Building
- [ ] GitHub repository with clear contributing guidelines
- [ ] Discord/Slack community for discussions
- [ ] Blog posts and tutorials
- [ ] Conference talks and presentations

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path to delivering a functional MVP of Takeo-ORM that demonstrates the core value proposition: high-performance database operations through Go while maintaining a familiar Python developer experience. The MVP focuses on essential features while laying the groundwork for more advanced capabilities in future releases.
